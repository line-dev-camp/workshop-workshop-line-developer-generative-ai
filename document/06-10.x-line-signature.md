When your bot server receives a request, verify the request sender. To make sure the request is from the LINE Platform, make your bot server verify the signature in the x-line-signature request header.

1. Compute the digest for the request body. Use the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm with the channel secret as the secret key.
2. Check if the Base64-encoded digest matches the signature in the x-line-signature request header.
